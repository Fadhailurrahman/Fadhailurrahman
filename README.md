### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a **Frontend-dominant Fullstack Developer (Junior → Intermediate)** who enjoys building clean, responsive, and interactive web applications.

I believe in **learning by doing** — most of my skills come from experimenting, building small to medium projects, breaking things, and fixing them again.  
Currently, I’m deepening my understanding of **modern frontend ecosystems** while gradually strengthening my backend fundamentals.
